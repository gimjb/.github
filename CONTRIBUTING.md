## How to Contribute

### Issues

#### Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug in the project, we encourage you to report it using the
issue tracker. Here are some guidelines for submitting an issue:

- **Search for existing issues first.** Before submitting a new issue, please
  search the issue tracker to see if someone else has already reported it. If
  you find an existing issue that matches your problem, you can add a comment to
  provide more details or to show your support for that issue.

- Include as much information as possible. When you submit a new issue, please
  provide as much detail as possible, including:

  - A clear and descriptive title that summarizes the issue
  - A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the unexpected behavior
  - The expected behavior and the actual behavior you observed
  - Any error messages or logs that you received
  - Your environment (e.g. operating system, browser, version number)

- **Use labels to help organize issues.** We use labels to categorize issues and
  help us prioritize them. When you submit an issue, please assign appropriate
  labels to it. If you‚Äôre not sure which labels to use, you can ask for help in
  the issue comments.

#### Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement to the project, we welcome
your input! Before submitting a new feature request, please search the issue
tracker to see if someone else has already proposed it. If you find an existing
feature request that matches your idea, you can add a comment to show your
support for that request.

When submitting a new feature request, please provide as much detail as
possible, including:

- A clear and descriptive title that summarizes the request
- A description of the problem or need that the feature would address
- A proposed solution or approach for implementing the feature
- Any potential drawbacks or limitations of the proposed feature
- Any relevant examples or use cases

Use labels to help organize feature requests. We use labels to categorize issues
and help us prioritize them. When you submit a feature request, please assign
appropriate labels to it. If you‚Äôre not sure which labels to use, you can ask
for help in the issue comments.

### Pull Requests

If you want to contribute code to the project, you can do so by submitting a
pull request. Here are some guidelines for submitting a pull request:

- **Make sure there is an issue related to your change.** Before you start
  working on your changes, it‚Äôs a good idea to check the issue tracker to see if
  there is an existing issue related to your proposed change. If there isn‚Äôt an
  existing issue, you can create one to discuss your proposal with the project
  maintainers and other contributors.

- **Search for existing pull requests first.** Before submitting a new pull
  request, please search the pull request tracker to see if someone else has
  already submitted a similar pull request. If you find an existing pull
  request, you can add a comment to show your support for that request or to
  provide additional feedback.

- **Fork and clone the repository.** Before you start working on your changes,
  you should fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. You can do
  this by clicking the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button on the project‚Äôs GitHub page, and then
  running git clone to download the code.

- **Create a branch for your changes.** When you‚Äôre ready to start working on
  your changes, create a new branch in your forked repository to isolate your
  changes from the master branch. You can name your branch anything you like,
  but it‚Äôs a good idea to choose something descriptive that summarizes your
  changes.

- **Make your changes and commit them.** Once you‚Äôve created your branch, you
  can make your changes to the code. Make sure to write clear and concise commit
  messages that explain what you changed and why. <!-- Todo: Add link to commit
  message guidelines. -->

- **Push your changes and submit a pull request.** When you‚Äôre finished making
  your changes, push your branch to your forked repository and submit a pull
  request to the main project. We‚Äôll review your changes and provide feedback,
  and we may ask you to make additional changes before we merge your code.

- **Be open to feedback and discussion.** Pull requests are a collaborative
  process, and we encourage you to be open to feedback and discussion from the
  project maintainers and other contributors. Please be respectful and
  constructive in your comments, and work together to make the best possible
  code.
